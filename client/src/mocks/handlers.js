                "The Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC 2.28%) cryptocurrency is and Ethereum (ETH 3.08%) token that mirrors the value of an ordinary Bitcoin (BTC 1.84%) token. This odd arrangement gives Ethereum-based applications access to a Bitcoin-like system for value storage and money transfers. You can also look at it as a version of Bitcoin that also offers Ethereum-like benefits such as smart contracts.\nBaking the upside of two very different cryptocurrencies into a single package makes a lot of sense, but isn't this idea too good to be true? Holders of Wrapped Bitcoin must shoulder the long-term ownership risks of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, after all.",
